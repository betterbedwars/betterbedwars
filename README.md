![Optifine Required for SE](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/cbccb39d16b4348e6d1e5bd09eef4dbeee040fa4.png)

<br/><br/>
The Special Edition (SE) version of this pack uses an Optifine feature called Custom Sky to change the skybox texture.
<br>
**THE SKYBOX WILL NOT BE SHOWN IF OPTIFINE IS NOT USED!**
<br>
As an alternative to Optifine, you can choose one of these two options
<br/><br/>
**Forge:** [<u>ForgeSkyboxes</u>](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forgeskyboxes) (alongside the [<u>MCPPPP</u>](https://github.com/supsm/MCPPPP) tool)
<br>
**Fabric:** [<u>FabricSkyboxes</u>](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabricskyboxes) (combined with the [<u>FabricSkyboxes Interop</u>](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabricskyboxes-interop) addon mod)

<br/><br/>

### **Having issues?**
- **Make sure you have these settings:** Video Settings > Quality > **Custom Sky : ON**
- For Non-OptiFine users: Make sure you are using the tool or addon mod that I have provided alongside the mods

If you ask a question that's already answered in the spoiler below, I will most likely ignore it.

<summary>Frequently Asked Questions:</summary>

**Q: Can you make a version for 1.XX ? / The pack is warning me that it's made for another version of Minecraft.**
<br>
**A:** No, also don't worry. Better Bedwars is intended to work on all versions of the game, the only requirement is that it is a version after 1.8.9 and if using the Special Edition (SE) that you are using a compatibile version of OptiFine. So, feel free to play on whatever version you are most comfortable with, including the most recent version as this pack is always tested on both versions 1.8.9 and the most recent Minecraft release to check for any possible combatibility issues. Don't worry about the version warning! 
<br/><br/>
**Q: Can you make a Bedrock port?**
<br>
**A:** No need to ask, as there is now a version of Better Bedwars for Bedrock Edition. The Better Bedwars: Bedrock Edition can be downloaded on both CurseForge and MCPEDL.
<br/><br/>
**Q: Can you add _________ to Better Bedwars?**
<br>
**A:** Most likely not. I work and add new stuff to Better Bedwars at my own pace and when I feel that it is necessary. However, if you do have any request or suggestions, feel free to leave a comment or say something in the Discord.
<br/><br/>
**Q: What will I be missing out on by playing on the most recent Minecraft release rather than version 1.8.9?**
<br>
**A:** Not much, over the past few Better Bedwars updates, the pack has become more and more compatible with the newer versions, and the only feature that is missing is colorless water and it is currently unfixable in Vanilla Minecraft. The reason why colorless water is no longer possible on newer versions is because Minecraft changed the water colormap to be hardcoded, meaning the color cannot be changed, however you can still get colorless water on the newer versions by using [<u>Polytone</u>](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/polytone)
<br/><br/>
**Q: What is the difference between the regular version and the Special Edition (SE)?**
<br>
**A:** The regular version and the Special Edition (SE) are fairly similar except for a few differences, which are listed below
<br>
– Soft red hearts instead of the regular yellow ones
<br>
– Watermelon hungerbar instead of the regular potato hungerbar
<br>
– Red settings background instead of the regular yellow one
<br>
– Red Better Bedwars bed instead of the regular yellow-colored one (These bed textures can only be seen if playing on a version prior to 1.12)
<br>
– Custom Skybox
<br/><br/>
**Q: Why can I not see the custom skybox on the Special Edition (SE) version of the pack?**
<br>
**A:** This can occur when you haven't installed the Optifine Mod correctly, or when Custom Sky is not enabled in Video Settings. The required settings are as follows:
<br>
      _Video Settings > Quality > Custom Sky: ON_
<br>
**A:** This can also happen with using some 3rd party clients.
<br>
**A:** Also make sure you're using the right Optifine version.
<br/><br/>
**Q: Is there a way to use Better Bedwars: Special Edition (SE) without OptiFine?**
<br>
**A:** Better Bedwars: Special Edition (SE) requires Optifine for features like Custom Sky to work. If you don't want to use OptiFine, but still want to use the Special Edition (SE) version of the pack, then you can use some OptiFine Custom Sky alternative mods like [<u>ForgeSkyboxes</u>](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forgeskyboxes) (along with a tool called [<u>MCPPPP</u>](https://github.com/supsm/MCPPPP) which is needed in order to convert this pack to use FSB formatted skies) or [<u>FabricSkyboxes</u>](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabricskyboxes) (combined with the [<u>FabricSkyboxes Interop</u>](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabricskyboxes-interop) addon mod). Keep in mind that this pack has not been tested with these mods and conflicts could arise.
<br/><br/>
**Q: I found a bug/issue with Better Bedwars. What should I do?**
<br>
**A:** Create a ticket on the Discord server
